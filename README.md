# Grocery-Shopping-ABM-Model
 A NetLogo simulation of a grocery store that shows traffic and sales in a grocery store.

A grocery model that measures the traffic of customers. It also includes how customers leave when there's too many customers at a time in the grocery.

## Agents
The customers shop with a pre-determined bucket list that is randomized. They follow a certain max-items. This max-items determines the number of items they can have in the bucket list. They shop for these items then move into checkout then leave.
If their tolerance for number of people in the grocery reaches a certain threshhold, they also leave.
